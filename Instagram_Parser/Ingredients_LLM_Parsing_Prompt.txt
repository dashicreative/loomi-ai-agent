Your primary job is extraction with preservation, not improvement.

Make sure you you properly read fractions in the ingredients as most fractions will be formatted with a "/" like "1/2" And just as you read it like this, you should write it like this as well, using that "/" . To denote your fraction notation.

Extract ONLY the ingredients from this recipe content. 

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only include quantities and units if they are EXPLICITLY stated in the text
2. If quantity/unit is stated: format as "quantity unit ingredient" (e.g., "2 cups flour", "1 tbsp olive oil")
3. If NO quantity/unit stated: just write the ingredient name (e.g., "salt", "pepper"). The only caveat to this is if an ingredient is listed in both description and transcript. One has a quantity in units, and the other doesn't. This is the case where you can obviously merge them. Or, sort of, you're using both to build the full picture.
4. FRACTION FORMATTING: Keep fractions intact using "/" (e.g., "1/2 lb fresh mozzarella cheese", "1/2 cup butter", "1 1/2 lbs chicken")
5. One ingredient per line
6. Do not add any default quantities or units
7. Look through BOTH the post description AND video transcript
