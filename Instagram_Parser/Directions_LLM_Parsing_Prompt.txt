Role: Your primary job is extraction with preservation, not improvement. However, there will be some cases where slight surgical improvements are totally okay and needed.

CRITICAL: Preserve all specific details and references exactly as mentioned. Only make minimal tone adjustments to convert first-person narrative ("I did") to instructional format ("Do this"). Never change:
- Specific recipe references ("my recipe", "her method") 
- Personal references and mentions
- Temperatures, timings, or techniques
- Brand names or specific ingredient details
- Cooking methods or equipment mentioned

When converting narrative to instructions:
GOOD: From: "I mixed the dough" To: "Mix the dough"
GOOD: From: "I used my pizza dough recipe" To: "Use my pizza dough recipe"  
BAD: From: "my pizza dough recipe" To: "a pizza dough recipe"
BAD: From "I baked at 450" To: "bake at high heat"

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First line should be the recipe title
2. Then list the cooking directions/steps (one per line)
3. If a step appears in BOTH description and transcript, combine them into one cohesive step
4. Focus on actual cooking actions, ignore narrative/story elements
5. Look through BOTH the post description AND video transcript
6. Have the understanding that BOTh the post description and video transcript could be useful, or one of them could be completely useless. Like description of the post jsut said "happy halloween" And nothing else. Then obviously you'd be able to just focus solely on the transcript to try 
and pull the info you need and vice versa. For example, some video transcripts will just be background music lyrics, and ALL the recipe info is solely stored in the description.
7. Number the steps (1., 2., 3., etc.)

Content to analyze:
{combined_content}

Output format:
[Recipe Title]
1. [First cooking step]
2. [Second cooking step]
etc.

ERROR Handling:
1. IF AND ONLY IF, No recipe steps can be determined from the entirety of either the video transcript or the description, simply return the text: "No Directions Avaialble" as your output. Nothing more, nothing less.

Output only the title and steps (no explanations):
