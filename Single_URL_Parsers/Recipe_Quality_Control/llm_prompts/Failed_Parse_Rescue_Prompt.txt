TASK: Extract quantity, unit, and ingredient name from ingredients that failed automatic parsing.

You are receiving ingredients where the regex parser failed to extract proper quantity/unit information.
These ingredients were defaulted to "1 count" but SOME may have quantity/unit embedded in the name.
Your job: IF you find quantity/unit in the name, extract it and clean the name. OTHERWISE, leave as "1 count".

INPUT FORMAT:
You will receive a semicolon-delimited list of ingredient strings (just the name field).
SOME ingredients will have quantity/unit embedded in them (like "15 oz. red sauce").
SOME ingredients will NOT have quantity/unit and are legitimately "1 count" items (like "apple" or "egg").

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each ingredient, return: quantity|unit|name
Separate ingredients with semicolons.
Example: 15|oz|red enchilada sauce;1|count|apple;1/2|cup|milk

CORE REASONING PRINCIPLES:

1. FIRST, CHECK IF QUANTITY/UNIT EXISTS IN THE NAME
   - Look for numbers, fractions, or unit words (cup, oz, tablespoon, etc.)
   - If NONE found → ingredient is legitimately "1 count", leave it as-is
   - If found → proceed to extract

2. IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY QUANTITY (if present)
   - Look for the main quantity that tells you "how much" of this ingredient
   - For nested quantities like "1 (15 oz.) can beans", use the CONTENT weight (15 oz), not the container count

3. EXTRACT THE UNIT (if present)
   - Common units: cup, cups, tablespoon, tablespoons, tbsp, teaspoon, tsp, oz, lb, lbs, g, kg
   - Count units: count, piece, pieces, slice, slices, clove, cloves, can, jar, package, bag

4. CLEAN THE NAME
   - Remove ALL quantity/unit text from the name
   - Remove preparation notes in parentheses: (diced), (drained), (minced), (rinsed)
   - KEEP ingredient descriptors: "fresh", "yellow", "ripe", "diced" when it's part of the ingredient type

5. PRESERVE QUANTITY FORMATS
   - Whole numbers: "2", "10", "15"
   - Fractions: "1/2", "1/4", "3/4"
   - Mixed numbers with space: "1 1/2"
   - Ranges: "1-2", "8-10"
   - Decimals: "0.5", "1.5"

REASONING EXAMPLES:

Example 1: "10 fresh basil leaves"
REASONING: "10" is quantity, "leaves" could be a unit but it's not standard, so use "count" for counting items
OUTPUT: 10|count|fresh basil

Example 2: "15 oz. red enchilada sauce"
REASONING: "15" is quantity, "oz." is ounces (ignore the period), "red enchilada sauce" is the ingredient
OUTPUT: 15|oz|red enchilada sauce

Example 3: "1-2 tablespoons avocado oil"
REASONING: "1-2" is a range quantity, "tablespoons" is the unit, "avocado oil" is the ingredient
OUTPUT: 1-2|tablespoons|avocado oil

Example 4: "1 (15 oz.) can black beans (drained and rinsed)"
REASONING: This has nested quantities. The content weight is 15 oz (what you're actually using), not 1 can (just the container). Remove preparation notes.
OUTPUT: 15|oz|black beans

Example 5: "1 (4 oz.) can diced green chiles"
REASONING: Content weight is 4 oz. "diced" is part of the ingredient type (diced chiles), so keep it in the name.
OUTPUT: 4|oz|diced green chiles

Example 6: "8 (8 inch) flour tortillas"
REASONING: You need 8 tortillas (that's what you're counting). The "8 inch" is just a size descriptor, ignore it.
OUTPUT: 8|count|flour tortillas

Example 7: "Heaping 1/2 cup pizza sauce"
REASONING: "Heaping" is an editorial descriptor (not a quantity). The real quantity is "1/2", unit is "cup".
OUTPUT: 1/2|cup|pizza sauce

Example 8: "1/2 yellow onion (diced)"
REASONING: "1/2" is quantity, "onion" is not a standard unit so use "count". "yellow" is a descriptor (keep it). "(diced)" is preparation (remove it).
OUTPUT: 1/2|count|yellow onion

Example 9: "2 ripe peaches"
REASONING: "2" is quantity, "peaches" is not a standard unit so use "count". "ripe" is a descriptor (keep it).
OUTPUT: 2|count|ripe peaches

Example 10: "1/2 garlic clove, minced"
REASONING: "1/2" is quantity, "clove" is a standard unit for garlic. "minced" after the comma is preparation (remove it).
OUTPUT: 1/2|clove|garlic

Example 11: "3 large eggs"
REASONING: "3" is quantity, "eggs" is not a standard unit so use "count". "large" is a descriptor (keep it).
OUTPUT: 3|count|large eggs

Example 12: "1 1/2 lbs chicken breast"
REASONING: "1 1/2" is a mixed number quantity (note the space), "lbs" is pounds, "chicken breast" is the ingredient.
OUTPUT: 1 1/2|lbs|chicken breast

Example 13: "Pinch of salt"
REASONING: "Pinch" is a non-standard quantity descriptor. Interpret as a small amount, use fraction.
OUTPUT: 1/8|tsp|salt

Example 14: "Handful fresh cilantro"
REASONING: "Handful" is non-standard. For herbs, estimate as a reasonable amount.
OUTPUT: 1/4|cup|fresh cilantro

EXAMPLES WHERE NO EXTRACTION IS NEEDED (Leave as "1 count"):

Example 15: "apple"
REASONING: No quantity/unit in the name. This is legitimately "1 count apple".
OUTPUT: 1|count|apple

Example 16: "egg"
REASONING: No quantity/unit in the name. This is legitimately "1 count egg".
OUTPUT: 1|count|egg

Example 17: "salt"
REASONING: No quantity/unit in the name. Could be "to taste" or unspecified. Default to "1 count".
OUTPUT: 1|count|salt

Example 18: "lemon"
REASONING: No quantity/unit in the name. This is legitimately "1 count lemon".
OUTPUT: 1|count|lemon

Example 19: "fresh parsley"
REASONING: No quantity/unit in the name. "fresh" is a descriptor. Default to "1 count".
OUTPUT: 1|count|fresh parsley

Example 20: "sea salt"
REASONING: No quantity/unit in the name. "sea" is a type descriptor. Default to "1 count".
OUTPUT: 1|count|sea salt

IMPORTANT: Some ingredients you receive may NOT have quantity/unit embedded.
If you see a simple ingredient name with no numbers or unit words, output "1|count|name" unchanged.

ACCEPTABLE UNITS (for reference):
cup, cups, tablespoon, tablespoons, tbsp, teaspoon, tsp, ml, milliliter, milliliters, l, liter, liters,
oz, ounce, ounces, lb, lbs, pound, pounds, g, gram, grams, kg, kilogram, kilograms,
piece, pieces, slice, slices, clove, cloves, bunch, bunches, head, heads,
can, cans, jar, jars, package, packages, bag, bags, count

WHAT TO REMOVE FROM NAME:
- Quantities: "1", "2", "1/2", "1-2", etc.
- Units: "cups", "oz", "tablespoons", etc.
- Parenthetical prep notes: "(diced)", "(minced)", "(drained and rinsed)"
- Editorial descriptors before quantities: "Heaping", "Scant", "Generous"
- Size descriptors in parentheses: "(8 inch)", "(medium)"

WHAT TO KEEP IN NAME:
- Ingredient type descriptors: "fresh basil", "yellow onion", "ripe peaches"
- Ingredient states when part of the type: "diced green chiles" (diced is the product type)
- Quality descriptors: "extra virgin olive oil", "kosher salt"

Ingredients to rescue:
{failed_ingredients}

Output only quantity|unit|name format with semicolon delimiters (no explanations, no extra text):
