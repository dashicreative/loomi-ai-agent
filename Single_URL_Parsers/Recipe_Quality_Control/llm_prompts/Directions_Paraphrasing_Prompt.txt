TASK: Conservative paraphrasing of cooking directions to address copyright concerns while maintaining identical cooking results.

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Your job is SURGICAL EDITORIAL CLEANUP, not recipe direction rewriting. Make minimal word/phrase changes only.

NEVER CHANGE (Preserve 100%):
• Temperatures: "350°F", "medium heat", "boiling" 
• Times: "bake for 25 minutes", "cook until tender", "rest for 5 minutes"
• Measurements: "1 cup", "2 tablespoons", "1/2 teaspoon"
• Cooking techniques: "whisk", "fold", "sauté", "braise" (these have specific meanings)
• Safety instructions: "cook until internal temperature reaches 165°F"
• Ingredient names: "heavy cream", "kosher salt", "vanilla extract"
• Equipment: "stand mixer", "9-inch pan", "large skillet"

ACCEPTABLE SURGICAL CHANGES (Editorial cleanup):
• Personal voice: "I like to add" → "you can add"
• Subjective descriptors: "beautifully golden" → "golden brown"
• Editorial flourishes: "lovingly combine" → "combine"
• Possessive references: "my favorite method" → "this method"
• Flowery language: "gently fold with care" → "fold in gently"
• Opinion words: "perfectly seasoned" → "well seasoned"

CONSERVATIVE WORD SWAPPING EXAMPLES:

✅ GOOD Examples (Surgical changes):
Original: "Gently fold the flour into the wet ingredients until just combined"
Paraphrased: "Fold flour into wet ingredients until just combined"
[Removed "gently" - editorial, kept technique "fold"]

Original: "I love to season generously with my favorite kosher salt"
Paraphrased: "Season generously with kosher salt"
[Removed personal voice, kept "generously" and "kosher salt"]

Original: "Whisk the eggs until they're beautifully pale and fluffy"
Paraphrased: "Whisk eggs until pale and fluffy" 
[Removed "beautifully", kept technical result "pale and fluffy"]

Original: "Carefully transfer the delicate mixture to your prepared pan"
Paraphrased: "Transfer mixture to prepared pan"
[Removed editorial words, kept core action]

❌ BAD Examples (Too aggressive):
Original: "Fold the chocolate chips gently into the batter"
BAD: "Mix chocolate chips into batter" [WRONG - changed technique!]
GOOD: "Fold chocolate chips into batter" [Kept technique, removed editorial]

Original: "Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes until golden brown"  
BAD: "Bake at moderate heat until done" [WRONG - lost specifics!]
GOOD: "Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes until golden brown" [No change needed]

ADVANCED EXAMPLES:

Original: "In a large bowl, I like to cream the butter and sugar together using my stand mixer until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, which usually takes about 3-4 minutes on medium speed."
Paraphrased: "In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar together using stand mixer until mixture becomes light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes on medium speed."
[Removed personal voice, kept all technical details]

Original: "Next, you'll want to gradually add the eggs one at a time, making sure to beat well after each addition to ensure a smooth, homogeneous mixture."
Paraphrased: "Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition to ensure smooth mixture."
[Simplified language, kept technique and purpose]

Original: "Pour the beautiful batter into your lovingly prepared springform pan and gently tap to release any air bubbles."
Paraphrased: "Pour batter into prepared springform pan and tap to release air bubbles."
[Removed flowery language, kept all actions]

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
• Input: Numbered steps separated by | delimiter
• Output: Paraphrased steps separated by | delimiter  
• Maintain exact same number of steps
• Preserve step numbering and order
• Focus on reasoning (what to change) not formatting

INPUT FORMAT: 1. First step text|2. Second step text|3. Third step text
OUTPUT FORMAT: 1. Paraphrased first step|2. Paraphrased second step|3. Paraphrased third step

ERROR HANDLING:
If the directions cannot be safely paraphrased while maintaining cooking accuracy, return: "No Paraphrasing Available"

SAFETY CHECK:
Before making ANY change, ask: "Would this change affect the cooking result?" If yes, keep original.
