TASK: Conservative quality control cleanup of ingredient list to fix parsing issues and remove editorial content.

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Your job is SURGICAL QUALITY CONTROL, not ingredient rewriting. Most ingredients should pass through UNCHANGED.

WHEN TO LEAVE UNCHANGED (95% of ingredients):
• Normal ingredients: "2 cups flour", "1 lb chicken breast", "3 cloves garlic"
• Cooking descriptors: "chicken breast, diced", "onion, chopped", "cheese, shredded"
• Preparation notes: "garlic, minced", "tomatoes, crushed", "butter, softened"
• Brands/varieties: "kosher salt", "extra virgin olive oil", "sharp cheddar cheese"
• Alternative ingredients: "chicken breast or thigh", "paprika or cayenne"

ONLY MODIFY IN THESE EXTREME CASES:

1. MULTI-INGREDIENT LUMPING (Split into separate ingredients):
✅ "1 tsp EACH:onion powder, cumin, paprika" → "1 tsp onion powder;1 tsp cumin;1 tsp paprika"
✅ "2 tbsp each of: salt, pepper, garlic powder" → "2 tbsp salt;2 tbsp pepper;2 tbsp garlic powder"
✅ "1/2 cup combined: flour and cornstarch" → "1/2 cup flour;1/2 cup cornstarch"
✅ "2 1/2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 3 Tbsp beef broth" → "2 1/2 tbsp cornstarch;3 tbsp beef broth"

2. EDITORIAL/WEBSITE TEXT REMOVAL (Remove parenthetical comments):
✅ "2 cups flour (I highly recommend King Arthur)" → "2 cups flour"
✅ "1 lb chicken breast (see notes)" → "1 lb chicken breast"
✅ "3 eggs (check full recipe for details)" → "3 eggs"
✅ "1 tsp vanilla (optional)" → "1 tsp vanilla"
✅ "salt to taste (about 1 tsp)" → "salt to taste"

CONSERVATIVE EXAMPLES:

✅ KEEP UNCHANGED (Good ingredients):
- "2 cups all-purpose flour" → NO CHANGE
- "1 lb chicken breast, diced" → NO CHANGE  
- "3 cloves garlic, minced" → NO CHANGE
- "1/2 cup olive oil, extra virgin" → NO CHANGE
- "1 tsp salt, kosher" → NO CHANGE
- "2 tbsp butter, unsalted" → NO CHANGE
- "1 cup cheese, grated" → NO CHANGE

✅ SPLIT MULTI-INGREDIENTS (Fix parsing issues):
- "1 tsp EACH:salt, pepper, garlic powder" → "1 tsp salt;1 tsp pepper;1 tsp garlic powder"
- "2 cups each: flour and sugar" → "2 cups flour;2 cups sugar"
- "1/4 cup combined fresh herbs: basil, oregano, thyme" → "1/4 cup fresh basil;1/4 cup fresh oregano;1/4 cup fresh thyme"

✅ REMOVE EDITORIAL NOTES (Clean up website text):
- "2 lbs chicken (I love organic but regular is fine)" → "2 lbs chicken"
- "1 cup flour (see recipe notes for gluten-free option)" → "1 cup flour"
- "3 eggs (room temperature works best)" → "3 eggs"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract (pure, not imitation!)" → "1 tsp vanilla extract"

❌ DO NOT CHANGE (Keep cooking descriptors):
- "chicken breast, shredded" → DO NOT CHANGE (shredded is cooking instruction)
- "1 onion, diced" → DO NOT CHANGE (diced is preparation)
- "2 tomatoes, crushed" → DO NOT CHANGE (crushed is preparation)
- "1/2 cup butter, melted" → DO NOT CHANGE (melted is preparation)

❌ NEVER ADD CONTENT:
- DO NOT add quantities if missing
- DO NOT add units if missing  
- DO NOT add preparation methods
- DO NOT add ingredient alternatives
- DO NOT add cooking notes

EDGE CASES:

Complex Editorial Removal:
- "2 cups flour (I've tested 5 brands and King Arthur works best - see my blog post)" → "2 cups flour"
- "1 lb ground beef (85/15 lean ratio recommended, but 80/20 works too)" → "1 lb ground beef"

Multi-ingredient with Editorial:
- "1 tsp EACH of my favorite spices: cumin, paprika (see notes for substitutions)" → "1 tsp cumin;1 tsp paprika"

Quantity Inheritance for Splits:
- "3 tbsp each: olive oil and butter" → "3 tbsp olive oil;3 tbsp butter"
- "1/2 cup EACH: flour, sugar, cocoa powder" → "1/2 cup flour;1/2 cup sugar;1/2 cup cocoa powder"

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
• Input: Semicolon-separated list of ingredients
• Output: Semicolon-separated list of cleaned ingredients
• Maintain same order when possible
• When splitting, place split ingredients in sequence

ERROR HANDLING:
If an ingredient cannot be safely cleaned without losing meaning, leave it unchanged.

SAFETY CHECK:
Before making ANY change, ask: "Is this ingredient clear and unambiguous for cooking?" If yes, leave unchanged.
