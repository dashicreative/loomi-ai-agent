CRITICAL HIERARCHY OF RULES:

1. RESPECT ORIGINAL NUMBERING (Priority #1)
If the recipe already has numbered steps (1., 2., 3., etc. or Step 1, Step 2, etc.), preserve that exact numbering structure. Do NOT break numbered steps into smaller sub-steps. The author's numbering is authoritative.

Example:
Original: "1. Preheat oven. Grease pan."
Output: 1. Preheat oven. Grease pan.
(Keep as single step - do NOT split into step 1 and step 2)

2. FOR UNNUMBERED RECIPES - USE LOGICAL COOKING PHASES
When no numbers exist, group related actions into logical cooking phases rather than separating every micro-action.

CORE PRINCIPLE: Your primary job is extraction with preservation, not improvement.

WHAT DEFINES A NEW STEP:
✅ Major technique changes
   - Going from mixing → baking
   - Going from stovetop → oven
   - Starting a completely new component (crust → filling → topping)

✅ Major waiting periods
   - "Bake for 1 hour"
   - "Refrigerate overnight"
   - "Let cool for 30 minutes"

✅ Equipment transitions with new ingredients
   - Moving mixture to a new pan
   - Starting work in a different bowl with new ingredients

✅ Explicit numbered steps in original text
   - If original says "Step 1:" or "1." - that's a step boundary

WHAT SHOULD NOT BE ITS OWN STEP:
❌ Follow-up micro-actions to the same ingredient/mixture
   - "Beat. Scrape again. Beat again." = ONE step
   - "Mix. Set aside." = ONE step
   - "Add sugar. Stir." = ONE step

❌ Single-word directives
   - "Enjoy!" should be combined with serving step
   - "Serve." should be combined with plating step

❌ Continuation of the same action in the same location
   - "Scrape the bowl" after "Beat the cream cheese" = same step
   - "Stir for another minute" after "Add garlic" = same step

STEP GROUPING LOGIC:
If multiple sentences describe actions on the SAME mixture/component in the SAME location without a major transition, they belong in the SAME step.

Example of CORRECT grouping:
"Beat the cream cheese until smooth. Scrape the bowl. Add the sugar and beat for a few more minutes. Scrape again."
→ ONE step (all actions on cream cheese in same bowl)

"Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition."
→ ONE step (continuous process on same mixture)

"Pour batter into pan. Bake for 60 minutes."
→ TWO steps (major transition: assembly → baking)

FORMATTING RULES:
- Start each step with number: "1. ", "2. ", "3. ", etc.
- One step per line
- Preserve all original details, temperatures, timings, measurements, and wording exactly
- Never editorialize or change the author's language
- If original has numbers, use those exactly

EXAMPLE INPUT (unnumbered):
"Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-inch pan.
Beat cream cheese until smooth. Scrape the bowl. Add sugar and beat for 2 minutes. Scrape again.
Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.
Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-inch pan.
2. Beat cream cheese until smooth. Scrape the bowl. Add sugar and beat for 2 minutes. Scrape again.
3. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.
4. Pour into prepared pan.
5. Bake for 1 hour.

EXAMPLE INPUT (already numbered):
"1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease pan. Line with parchment.
2. Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Mix well. Set aside.
3. Beat butter until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease pan. Line with parchment.
2. Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Mix well. Set aside.
3. Beat butter until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time.
(Numbers preserved exactly as in original)
