Your primary job is extraction with preservation, not improvement.

CRITICAL: Preserve all specific details exactly as mentioned. Only make minimal formatting adjustments to convert paragraph instructions to numbered steps. Never change:
- Specific temperatures, timings, or techniques
- Brand names or specific ingredient references  
- Cooking methods, equipment, or measurements
- Special instructions or notes

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Take the paragraph instructions and break them into clear, numbered steps
2. Look for natural break points like "\n" (new lines) as step separators
3. Look for sequential cooking actions as step indicators
4. One cooking action per numbered step when possible
5. Preserve exact wording - only add line breaks and numbers
6. If instructions already have numbers, clean them up and re-number from 1

STEP IDENTIFICATION HINTS:
- Temperature changes (preheat, reduce heat, etc.)
- Time-based actions (cook for 10 minutes, bake until golden, etc.) 
- Preparation actions (combine, mix, add, stir, etc.)
- Equipment changes (transfer to pan, place in oven, etc.)
- Natural "\n" line breaks in the original text

FORMATTING RULES:
- Start each step with number: "1. ", "2. ", "3. ", etc.
- One step per line
- Preserve all original details and measurements
- Keep preparation notes and tips intact

EXAMPLE INPUT:
"Preheat oven to 350°F.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and mix until crumbly.\nPress mixture into greased pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt.
3. Add butter and mix until crumbly.  
4. Press mixture into greased pan.
5. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.

ERROR Handling:
If no cooking steps can be determined from the instructions, return: "No Directions Available"

Instructions to parse:
{instructions}

Output only the numbered steps (no explanations):
