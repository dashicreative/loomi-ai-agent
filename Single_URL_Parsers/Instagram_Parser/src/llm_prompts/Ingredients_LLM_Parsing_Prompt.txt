Your primary job is extraction with preservation, not improvement.

Extract ONLY the ingredients from this recipe content. 

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only include quantities and units if they are EXPLICITLY stated in the text
2. Make sure you correctly identify quanitity + unit pairings in varous situations, for example "500g" would be "500 g" for your output. Dont let a lack of spaces confuse your unit recognition.
2. If quantity/unit is stated: format as "quantity unit ingredient" (e.g., "2 cups flour", "1 tbsp olive oil")
3. If NO quantity/unit stated: just write the ingredient name (e.g., "salt", "pepper"). The only caveat to this is if an ingredient is listed in both description and transcript. One has a quantity in units, and the other doesn't. This is the case where you can obviously merge them. Or, sort of, you're using both to build the full picture.
4. FRACTION FORMATTING: Keep fractions intact using "/" (e.g., "1/2 lb fresh mozzarella cheese", "1/2 cup butter", "1 1/2 lbs chicken")
5. One ingredient per line
6. Do not add any default quantities or units
7. Look through BOTH the post description AND video transcript

PARSING EDGE CASES - Handle these carefully:
• DECIMAL NUMBERS: Fix spacing issues (e.g., "3. 5 g" → "3.5 g", "0. 5 tsp" → "0.5 tsp")
• RANGES: Pick the larger amount for main ingredient (e.g., "200-250 g chicken" → "250 g chicken breast")
• COMPLEX QUANTITIES: Simplify to main amount (e.g., "⅔ cup + 1 tbsp water" → "165 g water" OR "⅔ cup water")
• ALTERNATIVES: You can leave both in the final output (e.g., "chicken breast or thigh", "paprika or cayenne")
• DUPLICATE UNITS: Consolidate to single entry (e.g., "240 g flour" + "2 cups flour" → "240 g all-purpose flour")
• QUALITATIVE AMOUNTS: Treat as no quantity (e.g., "salt to taste" → "salt", "dill (optional)" → "dill")
• PREPARATION NOTES: Include only in ingredient name (e.g., "1 garlic clove, minced" → "1 garlic clove, minced")
• UNICODE FRACTIONS: Convert to slash format (e.g., "½ tsp" → "1/2 tsp", "¼ cup" → "1/4 cup")
