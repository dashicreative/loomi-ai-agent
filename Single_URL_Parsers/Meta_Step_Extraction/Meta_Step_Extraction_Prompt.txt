Role: Your job is meta step identification with preservation, not editorial changes. Analyze cooking directions and identify which steps are section headers (meta steps) vs detailed implementation steps.

CRITICAL: This is extraction with preservation, not recipe improvement. Meta steps are OPTIONAL - do not force matches or hallucinate them. Only identify meta steps that are:
- Explicitly mentioned as section headers in the original recipe
- Short, punchy cooking actions (1-4 words like "Saute the veggies", "Poach the chicken")
- Followed by detailed implementation steps
- 100% clearly identifiable as section organizers
- If a step has no clear meta step to belong to, mark it as REGULAR with no meta step assignment

IDENTIFICATION RULES:
1. Meta steps are typically short phrases that describe a cooking technique or phase
2. They're usually followed by detailed steps explaining HOW to do that technique
3. Preserve the exact original step order - never rearrange
4. Only mark steps as meta steps if you're 100% confident they're section headers
5. It's perfectly fine if no meta steps exist - they are OPTIONAL, not required. If they are clearly stated YES its required to identify but if they are not dont assume.
6. Many steps will have NO meta step assignment - this is normal and correct
7. Don't get creative or guess - stick to what's explicitly there
8. Don't move steps around or change the cooking sequence

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Clear Meta Steps:
Steps: 1. Saute the veggies | 2. Heat oil in pan | 3. Add carrots and cook | 4. Poach the chicken | 5. Add chicken to pot | 6. Simmer for 15 minutes | 7. Serve | 8. Remove herbs and garnish
Output: Step1:META|Step2:REGULAR:Saute the veggies|Step3:REGULAR:Saute the veggies|Step4:META|Step5:REGULAR:Poach the chicken|Step6:REGULAR:Poach the chicken|Step7:META|Step8:REGULAR:Serve

Example 2 - No Clear Meta Steps:
Steps: 1. Heat oil in large pot | 2. Add onions and cook until soft | 3. Add garlic and spices | 4. Pour in broth and simmer
Output: Step1:REGULAR|Step2:REGULAR|Step3:REGULAR|Step4:REGULAR

Example 3 - Mixed Meta and Regular:
Steps: 1. Prepare the dough | 2. Mix flour and water | 3. Knead for 10 minutes | 4. Let rise for 1 hour | 5. Add toppings | 6. Spread sauce on dough | 7. Add cheese and pepperoni
Output: Step1:META|Step2:REGULAR:Prepare the dough|Step3:REGULAR:Prepare the dough|Step4:REGULAR:Prepare the dough|Step5:META|Step6:REGULAR:Add toppings|Step7:REGULAR:Add toppings

Example 4 - Partial Meta Steps (Mixed):
Steps: 1. Make the batter | 2. Cream butter and sugar | 3. Add eggs one at a time | 4. Fold in flour | 5. Preheat oven to 350°F | 6. Pour batter into pan | 7. Bake for 25 minutes | 8. Cool completely before frosting
Output: Step1:META|Step2:REGULAR:Make the batter|Step3:REGULAR:Make the batter|Step4:REGULAR:Make the batter|Step5:REGULAR|Step6:REGULAR|Step7:REGULAR|Step8:REGULAR

FORMAT EXPLANATION:
- META = This step is a section header
- REGULAR = Regular cooking step with NO meta step assignment
- REGULAR:MetaStepName = Regular step that belongs under the named meta step section
- Most steps will be REGULAR with no meta step - this is normal and correct

Now analyze the following:

Ingredients: {ingredients_list}

Steps: {numbered_steps}

Output format: Step1:META|Step2:REGULAR:MetaStepName|Step3:REGULAR|etc.

ERROR Handling:
If no clear analysis can be made, return: "No Meta Steps Available"

Output only the step classifications (no explanations):
