Role: Your job is meta step identification using the ANCHOR WORD STRATEGY. Find cooking phases by looking for anchor words that reference completed components, then work backwards to identify which steps created those components.

ANCHOR WORD STRATEGY:
Look for steps that mention completed items like "pour the batter", "add to the sauce", "transfer the mixture", "bake the cheesecake". These are your anchor points. Then work backwards to identify which previous steps created that batter/sauce/mixture/cheesecake.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Meta steps are OPTIONAL - only identify them if anchor words clearly indicate cooking phases
- NEVER create meta steps that aren't supported by anchor word evidence  
- If a recipe mentions "filling" somewhere, trace back to find the steps that made the filling
- Preserve exact original step order - never rearrange or edit steps
- Each step can only belong to ONE meta step section (no overlaps)

IDENTIFICATION PROCESS:
1. Scan ALL steps for anchor words: "pour the X", "add to the X", "transfer the X", "bake the X"
2. Identify what "X" represents (batter, sauce, filling, crust, etc.)
3. Work backwards to find which steps created that component
4. Group those creation steps under the appropriate meta step name
5. Only assign meta steps when anchor words provide clear evidence

ANCHOR WORD EXAMPLES:
✅ "pour the batter into pan" → Look for steps that made the batter
✅ "add vegetables to the sauce" → Look for steps that made the sauce  
✅ "transfer filling to crust" → Look for steps that made filling AND crust
✅ "simmer the soup" → Look for steps that built the soup base
❌ "mix everything together" → Too vague, no clear component reference

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Vegetable Soup (Anchor: "add to the soup"):
Recipe Title: Hearty Vegetable Soup
Steps: 1. Heat oil in large pot | 2. Add onions and celery, cook until soft | 3. Add carrots and cook 5 minutes | 4. Pour in broth | 5. Add potatoes and herbs | 6. Simmer the soup for 20 minutes | 7. Season with salt and pepper
Output: Step1:REGULAR:Sauté the vegetables|Step2:REGULAR:Sauté the vegetables|Step3:REGULAR:Sauté the vegetables|Step4:REGULAR:Build the soup|Step5:REGULAR:Build the soup|Step6:REGULAR:Build the soup|Step7:REGULAR
Reasoning: Steps 1-3 prepare vegetables, steps 4-6 build and simmer the soup. Step 6 "simmer the soup" is the anchor.

Example 2 - Protein Cheesecake (Anchor: "transfer mixture to crust"):
Recipe Title: Protein Cheesecake  
Steps: 1. Preheat oven to 320°F | 2. Crush protein cookies for crust | 3. Mix cookies with melted butter | 4. Press crust into pan | 5. Beat cream cheese until fluffy | 6. Add eggs, sugar, and vanilla | 7. Stir in cornstarch | 8. Transfer the cheesecake mixture to the prepared crust | 9. Bake for 60 minutes | 10. Cool completely
Output: Step1:REGULAR|Step2:REGULAR:Make the crust|Step3:REGULAR:Make the crust|Step4:REGULAR:Make the crust|Step5:REGULAR:Make the filling|Step6:REGULAR:Make the filling|Step7:REGULAR:Make the filling|Step8:REGULAR|Step9:REGULAR:Bake and finish|Step10:REGULAR:Bake and finish
Reasoning: Step 8 "transfer the cheesecake mixture to the prepared crust" shows both crust (steps 2-4) and filling (steps 5-7) were made.

Example 3 - Chicken Stir Fry (Multiple anchors):
Recipe Title: Teriyaki Chicken Stir Fry
Steps: 1. Mix soy sauce, honey, and ginger for sauce | 2. Cut chicken into strips | 3. Heat oil in wok | 4. Cook chicken until done | 5. Remove chicken | 6. Add broccoli and carrots to wok | 7. Stir-fry vegetables until crisp | 8. Return chicken to wok | 9. Pour the sauce over everything | 10. Toss to coat and serve
Output: Step1:REGULAR:Make the sauce|Step2:REGULAR:Prepare the chicken|Step3:REGULAR:Prepare the chicken|Step4:REGULAR:Prepare the chicken|Step5:REGULAR:Prepare the chicken|Step6:REGULAR:Cook the vegetables|Step7:REGULAR:Cook the vegetables|Step8:REGULAR|Step9:REGULAR|Step10:REGULAR
Reasoning: Step 9 "pour the sauce over everything" shows sauce was made in step 1. Multiple cooking phases identified.

Example 4 - Pancakes (Anchor: "pour batter"):
Recipe Title: Fluffy Pancakes
Steps: 1. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar in bowl | 2. Whisk eggs and milk in separate bowl | 3. Combine wet and dry ingredients | 4. Heat griddle over medium heat | 5. Pour batter onto griddle | 6. Cook until bubbles form | 7. Flip and cook other side | 8. Serve with syrup
Output: Step1:REGULAR:Make the batter|Step2:REGULAR:Make the batter|Step3:REGULAR:Make the batter|Step4:REGULAR:Cook the pancakes|Step5:REGULAR:Cook the pancakes|Step6:REGULAR:Cook the pancakes|Step7:REGULAR:Cook the pancakes|Step8:REGULAR
Reasoning: Step 5 "pour batter onto griddle" shows batter was made in steps 1-3. Steps 4-7 cook the pancakes.

FORMAT EXPLANATION:
- META = This step is a section header
- REGULAR = Regular cooking step with NO meta step assignment
- REGULAR:MetaStepName = Regular step that belongs under the named meta step section
- Most steps will be REGULAR with no meta step - this is normal and correct

Now analyze the following:

Recipe Title: {recipe_title}

Ingredients: {ingredients_list}

Steps: {numbered_steps}

Output format: Step1:META|Step2:REGULAR:MetaStepName|Step3:REGULAR|etc.

ERROR Handling:
If no clear analysis can be made, return: "No Meta Steps Available"

Output only the step classifications (no explanations):
