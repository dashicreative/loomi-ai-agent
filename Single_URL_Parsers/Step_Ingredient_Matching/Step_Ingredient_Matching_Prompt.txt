TASK: Match ingredient IDs to recipe steps. Each ingredient should appear EXACTLY ONCE at its first explicit mention.

MATCHING RULES (in priority order):
1. Only match when step text explicitly names the ingredient
2. Match on core ingredient name (ignore quantities, descriptors, parenthetical notes)
   - "crushed cookies" matches "12 protein cookies (crushed)" ✓
   - "cream cheese" matches "cream cheese (* See notes, room temperature)" ✓
   - "butter" matches "light butter (melted)" ✓
3. Each ingredient ID appears in exactly one step (first mention only)
4. Generic terms DO NOT match ingredients:
   - "mixture", "batter", "dough", "filling" = NO matches
   - "Transfer to pan" = NO matches (just moving, not adding)
5. If ingredient is never explicitly mentioned in ANY step, omit it from output

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
1. Read all ingredients and their IDs
2. Go through steps sequentially
3. For each step, identify explicitly named ingredients
4. Assign those ingredient IDs to that step
5. Never assign the same ID twice (skip if already used)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Step1:ID1,ID2|Step2:ID3|Step3:ID4
- Use actual step numbers from input
- List all matched IDs for that step
- Use empty after colon if no matches: Step4:|Step5:ID7

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Ingredients: I1:eggs | I2:flour | I3:milk | I4:butter
Steps: 1.Mix flour and eggs | 2.Add milk | 3.Pour batter into pan
Output: Step1:I2,I1|Step2:I3|Step3:

Example 2:
Ingredients: I10:cream cheese | I11:sugar | I12:vanilla
Steps: 1.Beat cream cheese with sugar | 2.Add vanilla | 3.Transfer mixture to pan
Output: Step1:I10,I11|Step2:I12|Step3:

Now process:
Ingredients: {ingredients_with_ids}
Steps: {numbered_steps}

Output only the mapping (no explanations):
