Role: Your job is ingredient-to-step matching. Create a cooking checklist where each ingredient appears only ONCE - when it's first used.

CRITICAL COOKING CHECKLIST PRINCIPLE: 
Think like you're cooking and checking off ingredients as you use them. Each ingredient should be assigned to only ONE step - the step where you first grab it from your ingredient list. This creates a progressive checklist where cooks know exactly when to use each ingredient.

CORE MATCHING RULES:
1. ONLY match ingredients explicitly mentioned BY NAME in that exact step
2. Each ingredient appears in EXACTLY ONE step (no duplicates across steps)
3. Never infer ingredients from generic terms like "mixture", "batter", "dough", "sauce"
4. If a step just transfers/moves something already made, assign ZERO ingredients
5. Don't assign ingredients based on what "should" be there - only what's explicitly named

WRONG APPROACH EXAMPLES:
❌ Step says "add chicken mixture" → Don't assign all chicken ingredients
❌ Step says "pour batter into pan" → Don't assign flour, eggs, etc.
❌ Step says "transfer cheesecake mixture" → Don't assign cream cheese, eggs, etc.

CORRECT APPROACH:
✅ Only assign ingredients when step says "add flour", "pour milk", "season with salt"
✅ Think: "When do I first grab each ingredient from my counter?"

INPUT FORMAT:
Ingredients will be provided with unique IDs like I12345, I67890, etc.
Steps will be numbered cooking instructions.

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Each ingredient used exactly once:
Ingredients: I101: olive oil | I102: chicken breast | I103: salt | I104: garlic
Steps: 1. Season chicken with salt | 2. Heat oil in pan | 3. Add seasoned chicken and garlic to pan
Output: Step1:I102,I103|Step2:I101|Step3:I104
Reasoning: Chicken and salt first used in step 1, oil first used in step 2, garlic first used in step 3. No duplicates.

Example 2 - Avoid "mixture" inference:
Ingredients: I201: cream cheese | I202: eggs | I203: sugar | I204: vanilla
Steps: 1. Beat cream cheese until fluffy | 2. Add eggs and sugar | 3. Stir in vanilla | 4. Pour mixture into pan
Output: Step1:I201|Step2:I202,I203|Step3:I204|Step4:
Reasoning: Step 4 says "pour mixture" but doesn't mention specific ingredients, so no ingredients assigned.

Example 3 - Transfer steps get zero ingredients:
Ingredients: I301: flour | I302: butter | I303: milk | I304: cheese
Steps: 1. Mix flour and butter | 2. Gradually add milk | 3. Stir in cheese | 4. Transfer sauce to serving dish
Output: Step1:I301,I302|Step2:I303|Step3:I304|Step4:
Reasoning: Step 4 is just transferring - no new ingredients mentioned.

Now analyze the following:

Ingredients: {ingredients_with_ids}

Steps: {numbered_steps}

Output format: Step1:ID1,ID2|Step2:ID3|Step3:ID1,ID4 etc.

ERROR Handling:
If no clear ingredient matches can be determined, return: "No Matches Available"

Output only the step-ingredient mapping (no explanations):
