Role: Your job is ingredient-to-step matching. Analyze cooking steps and determine which specific ingredients are used in each step based on cooking workflow and context.

CRITICAL: This is pattern recognition, not recipe improvement. Match ingredients to steps based on:
- Direct mentions of ingredients in step text
- Cooking workflow logic (prep ingredients used before cooking ingredients)
- Context from other steps (seasoned chicken from step 1 gets cooked in step 3)
- Quantity logic (large amounts typically used early, small amounts for finishing)

MATCHING RULES:
1. If an ingredient is directly mentioned in a step, it belongs to that step
2. If a step references a prepared item from previous steps, include those preparation ingredients
3. For ambiguous cases, use cooking logic and step context
4. Don't assign ingredients to steps where they're not actually used
5. Multiple steps can use the same ingredient if it's added at different times

INPUT FORMAT:
Ingredients will be provided with unique IDs like I12345, I67890, etc.
Steps will be numbered cooking instructions.

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Ingredients: I101: olive oil | I102: chicken breast | I103: salt | I104: garlic
Steps: 1. Season chicken with salt | 2. Heat oil in pan | 3. Add seasoned chicken and garlic to pan
Output: Step1:I102,I103|Step2:I101|Step3:I102,I104

Example 2:  
Ingredients: I201: pasta | I202: water | I203: salt | I204: butter | I205: parmesan
Steps: 1. Bring salted water to boil | 2. Add pasta to boiling water | 3. Drain and toss with butter and cheese
Output: Step1:I202,I203|Step2:I201|Step3:I201,I204,I205

Example 3:
Ingredients: I301: flour | I302: eggs | I303: milk | I304: sugar | I305: oil
Steps: 1. Whisk flour, sugar in bowl | 2. Beat eggs and milk together | 3. Combine wet and dry ingredients | 4. Heat oil in pan for frying
Output: Step1:I301,I304|Step2:I302,I303|Step3:I301,I302,I303,I304|Step4:I305

Now analyze the following:

Ingredients: {ingredients_with_ids}

Steps: {numbered_steps}

Output format: Step1:ID1,ID2|Step2:ID3|Step3:ID1,ID4 etc.

ERROR Handling:
If no clear ingredient matches can be determined, return: "No Matches Available"

Output only the step-ingredient mapping (no explanations):
