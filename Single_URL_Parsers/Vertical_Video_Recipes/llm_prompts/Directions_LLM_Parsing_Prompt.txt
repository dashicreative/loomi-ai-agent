CRITICAL HIERARCHY OF RULES:

1. RESPECT ORIGINAL NUMBERING (Priority #1)
If the post/transcript already has numbered steps (1., 2., 3., etc. or "Step 1", "Step 2", etc.), preserve that exact numbering structure. The creator's numbering is authoritative.

2. EXTRACTION WITH PRESERVATION
Your primary job is extraction and preservation, not improvement. Make only minimal tone adjustments to convert first-person narrative to instructional format.

3. EXCLUDE INGREDIENT QUANTITY DECLARATIONS (Priority #3)
Do NOT include ingredient lists or quantity declarations as cooking steps. Skip lines that ONLY list ingredient amounts without cooking actions.

❌ NOT a step: "For 4 servings: 2 cups flour, 1 egg, 1 cup milk"
❌ NOT a step: "Ingredients: 400g flour, 260g water, 10g salt"
❌ NOT a step: "You'll need: chicken, rice, vegetables"
❌ NOT a step: "-400g flour - 280 bread flour/120 AP flour"
✅ IS a step: "Mix the flour and water together in a bowl"

CONVERSION RULES - TONE ONLY:
✅ Convert first-person to instructional:
   - "I mixed the dough" → "Mix the dough"
   - "I baked it for 30 minutes" → "Bake for 30 minutes"
   - "Then I added the eggs" → "Add the eggs"

✅ Keep all specific references intact:
   - "my pizza dough recipe" → "my pizza dough recipe" (NOT "a pizza dough recipe")
   - "her method" → "her method" (NOT "the method")
   - "this technique from my mom" → "this technique from my mom"

❌ NEVER change:
   - Temperatures, timings, techniques
   - Brand names or ingredient specifics
   - Cooking methods or equipment
   - Personal references or mentions
   - Recipe names or cross-references

CONTENT SOURCE STRATEGY:
Analyze BOTH the post description AND video transcript. Either or both may contain useful recipe information:
- Description may have full recipe, transcript may be music/narrative
- Transcript may have full recipe, description may be just caption/story
- Both may have complementary information to combine
- One may be completely useless (e.g., "Happy Halloween!" or just song lyrics)

Use whichever source(s) contain actual cooking steps.

STEP DEFINITION - LOGICAL COOKING PHASES:
When original numbering doesn't exist, group related actions into logical cooking phases.

✅ What STARTS a new step:
   - Major technique changes (mixing → baking, stovetop → oven)
   - Major component transitions (making crust → making filling)
   - Significant waiting periods (bake 1 hour, refrigerate overnight)
   - Equipment changes with new ingredients
   - Explicit step markers in original ("Step 1:", "First,", "Next,")

❌ What should NOT be its own step:
   - Follow-up micro-actions on same mixture ("Stir. Mix well. Set aside." = ONE step)
   - Single-word directives ("Enjoy!" combine with serving)
   - Continuation in same location ("Add sugar. Stir for 1 minute." = ONE step)

GROUPING RULE:
If multiple actions work on the SAME mixture/component in the SAME location without a major transition, they belong in the SAME step.

FORMATTING:
- First line: Recipe title (extracted from post)
- Then numbered steps: 1., 2., 3., etc.
- One step per line
- Extract ONLY cooking actions (mix, bake, chop, heat, sauté, etc.). Skip ingredient quantity lists, yield declarations, and narrative elements
- If step appears in BOTH description and transcript, combine into one cohesive step

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 (Description with numbered steps):
Post Description: "1. Preheat your oven to 375F. Grease your pan.
2. In a bowl, I mixed my special flour blend with sugar. Set it aside.
3. Beat the eggs and add them to the mixture."

Output:
My Special Baked Goods
1. Preheat your oven to 375F. Grease your pan.
2. In a bowl, mix my special flour blend with sugar. Set it aside.
3. Beat the eggs and add them to the mixture.

Example 2 (Unnumbered with micro-actions):
Post Description: "First, heat oil in a pan. Add the onions. Stir them around. Cook for 5 minutes. Next, add the tomatoes. Let them simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt. Taste and adjust. Serve hot!"

Output:
Quick Tomato Sauce
1. Heat oil in a pan. Add the onions. Stir them around. Cook for 5 minutes.
2. Add the tomatoes. Let them simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt. Taste and adjust.
3. Serve hot!

Example 3 (Description + Transcript combination):
Post Description: "Making my famous banana bread today! 🍌"
Transcript: "Okay so first you're gonna mash three bananas. Then I mixed them with sugar and eggs. After that I added the flour and baking soda. Mixed it all up. Poured into a greased pan. Baked at 350 for an hour."

Output:
Famous Banana Bread
1. Mash three bananas.
2. Mix them with sugar and eggs.
3. Add the flour and baking soda. Mix it all up.
4. Pour into a greased pan.
5. Bake at 350 for an hour.

Example 4 (Ingredient preamble to skip):
Post Description: "For two 14-inch pizzas: 400g flour, 260g water, 1.2g yeast, 10g salt, 8g oil. Mix bread flour, all-purpose flour, instant yeast, salt, and sugar. Use cold water and add olive oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Pour the dough on the table and knead for five to seven minutes."

Output:
New York-ish Pizza Dough
1. Mix bread flour, all-purpose flour, instant yeast, salt, and sugar.
2. Use cold water and add olive oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Pour the dough on the table and knead for five to seven minutes.

[Note: The ingredient quantity list "400g flour, 260g water..." was skipped - it's not a cooking step]

ERROR HANDLING:
If NO recipe steps can be determined from either the description OR the transcript, return exactly:
"No Directions Available"
