Determine if the stated {macro_name} value has already been multiplied by servings.

RECIPE: {recipe_title}
SERVINGS: {servings}
STATED {macro_name_upper}: {stated_value}{unit}

INGREDIENT LIST:
{ingredient_list}

YOUR TASK:
1. Estimate the TOTAL {macro_name} for the entire recipe based on the ingredient list
2. Compare your estimate to the stated value ({stated_value}{unit})
3. Decide: Is {stated_value}{unit} the TOTAL for all {servings} servings, or PER SERVING?

ESTIMATION TIPS:
- Use your knowledge of typical {macro_name} values for common ingredients
- For "count" units with ambiguous quantities (like "1 count cherry tomatoes"), estimate reasonable amounts based on the recipe title
- Round estimates are fine - we just need to be in the right ballpark

DECISION LOGIC:
- If your estimate is CLOSE to stated value (within ~50%) → stated is TOTAL (already multiplied)
- If your estimate is CLOSE to stated × {servings} → stated is PER SERVING (needs multiplication)

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY one word: TRUE or FALSE
- TRUE = stated value is already the TOTAL (do NOT multiply)
- FALSE = stated value is PER SERVING (needs to be multiplied by {servings})
