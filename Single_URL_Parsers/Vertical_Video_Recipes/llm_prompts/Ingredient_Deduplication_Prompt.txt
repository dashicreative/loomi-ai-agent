TASK: Group duplicate ingredients for shopping context. Return deduplicated list with links to original IDs.

OBJECTIVE: Create shopping-friendly ingredient names by removing preparation notes while PRESERVING all product-defining descriptors.

CORE PRINCIPLE: Only combine ingredients if they are THE SAME PRODUCT with different preparation. Preserve all descriptors that define WHAT you buy, not HOW you prepare it.

GROUPING RULES:

1. ALWAYS PRESERVE product-defining descriptors (these define what you buy at the store):
   - Keep variety/type: "extra virgin olive oil" ≠ "olive oil" (different products)
   - Keep variety/type: "light olive oil" ≠ "extra virgin olive oil" (different products)
   - Keep size/variety: "baby cucumber" ≠ "cucumber" (different sizes)
   - Keep type: "Greek yogurt" ≠ "regular yogurt" (different products)
   - Keep type: "sea salt" ≠ "kosher salt" ≠ "salt" (different salt types)
   - Keep form: "chicken breast" ≠ "ground chicken" (different cuts)
   - Keep descriptors: "natural", "organic", "fresh", "frozen" (product attributes)

2. STRIP preparation/editorial notes (these describe cooking methods, not product identity):
   - Remove: "minced", "grated", "sliced", "diced", "chopped", "crushed", "juiced", "peeled"
   - Remove: "bottled", "room temperature", "melted", "softened", "beaten"
   - Remove: "and water removed", "finely chopped", "roughly chopped"
   - Example: "baby cucumber, grated and water removed" → "baby cucumber"
   - Example: "extra virgin olive oil, bottled" → "extra virgin olive oil"
   - Example: "garlic, minced" → "garlic"

3. NORMALIZE spelling/formatting variations (same product, different spelling):
   - "yoghurt" = "yogurt" → "yogurt" (standardize spelling)
   - "Greek-style yogurt" = "Greek style yogurt" → "Greek yogurt" (remove hyphens)
   - "cucumbers" = "cucumber" → "cucumber" (standardize to singular)

4. HANDLE semantic equivalents (different words, same shopping item):
   - "lemon" = "lemon juice" = "squeeze of lemon" → "lemon juice"
   - "cream cheese" = "cream cheese, room temperature" → "cream cheese"

5. COMBINE different quantities/units (same product = one shopping list entry):
   - "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil" + "2 tsp extra virgin olive oil" → "extra virgin olive oil"
   - "1 count baby cucumber, grated" + "2 count baby cucumber, sliced" → "baby cucumber"

DECISION RULE: Ask yourself "Would these be on different shelves at the grocery store?"
- If YES → Keep separate
- If NO → Combine (just strip prep notes)

OUTPUT FORMAT: META_ID:RawID1,RawID2|canonical_name

- One line per meta-ingredient
- Use META_1, META_2, META_3, etc. for meta IDs
- List all original ingredient IDs that belong to this group (comma-separated)
- Use pipe (|) to separate from canonical shopping name
- Preserve ALL product descriptors, remove ONLY preparation language

EXAMPLES:

Input:
I101: 1 count baby cucumber, grated and water removed
I102: 2 count baby cucumbers, sliced
I103: 15 g natural Greek-style yoghurt
I104: 2 tbsp natural Greek yogurt
I105: 1 count squeeze of lemon
I106: 1 count squeeze of lemon juice
I107: 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
I108: 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil, bottled

Output:
META_1:I101,I102|baby cucumber
META_2:I103,I104|natural Greek yogurt
META_3:I105,I106|lemon juice
META_4:I107,I108|extra virgin olive oil

---

Input:
I201: 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
I202: 2 tsp olive oil
I203: 1 clove garlic, minced
I204: 2 cloves garlic, crushed
I205: 1 tsp sea salt
I206: 1 pinch salt
I207: 3 oz baby cucumber
I208: 1 count cucumber, sliced

Output:
META_1:I201|extra virgin olive oil
META_2:I202|olive oil
META_3:I203,I204|garlic
META_4:I205|sea salt
META_5:I206|salt
META_6:I207|baby cucumber
META_7:I208|cucumber

Reasoning: "extra virgin olive oil" ≠ "olive oil" (different products, keep separate)
          "sea salt" ≠ "salt" (different types, keep separate)
          "baby cucumber" ≠ "cucumber" (different sizes, keep separate)
          "garlic, minced" = "garlic, crushed" (same product, different prep → combine)

CRITICAL NOTES:
- Every raw ingredient ID must appear exactly once across all meta-ingredients
- NEVER simplify product descriptors (extra virgin, baby, sea, Greek, light, etc.)
- ONLY strip preparation language (minced, sliced, grated, bottled, etc.)
- When in doubt, preserve specificity - users are intelligent and can decide

Now process the following ingredients:
{ingredients_with_ids}

Output only the meta-ingredient mappings (no explanations):
