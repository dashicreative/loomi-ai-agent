Extract macro nutrition values from this recipe content if present.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Calories: cal, kcal, kilocalories, calories, energy
- Protein: pro, protein, g protein
- Fat: fat, fats, g fat
- Carbs: carbs, carbohydrates, CHO, g carbs

ALSO LOOK FOR:
- Servings: serves, servings, portions, makes, yields

COMMON FORMATS CREATORS USE:
- "450 cal, 35g protein, 20g fat, 45g carbs"
- "571 kcals per portion"
- "46g PRO, 63g CHO, 20g FAT"
- "Macros: 500cal / 40p / 25f / 55c"
- "Per serving: 350 calories"
- "Serves 4"

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return exactly 5 values separated by commas in this order:
calories,protein,fat,carbs,servings

RULES:
1. Numbers only - no units (g, kcal, etc.)
2. If a value is not found, use 0
3. If servings not mentioned, use 1
4. Round to whole numbers
5. Do NOT calculate or estimate - only extract what is explicitly stated

EXAMPLES:
- Content has "571 kcals, 46g PRO, 20g FAT, 63g CHO, Serves 2" → 571,46,20,63,2
- Content has "450 calories, 35g protein" (no fat/carbs/servings) → 450,35,0,0,1
- Content has no nutrition info → 0,0,0,0,0
- Content has "Serves 4" but no macros → 0,0,0,0,0

CRITICAL: If no macro values are found anywhere, return: 0,0,0,0,0
The servings value alone without macros should still return all zeros.
