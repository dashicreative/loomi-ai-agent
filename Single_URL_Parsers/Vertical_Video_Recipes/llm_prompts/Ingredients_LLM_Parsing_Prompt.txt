Your primary job is extraction with preservation, not improvement.

Extract ONLY the ingredients from this recipe content. 

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only include quantities and units if they are EXPLICITLY stated in the text
2. Make sure you correctly identify quanitity + unit pairings in varous situations, for example "500g" would be "500 g" for your output. Dont let a lack of spaces confuse your unit recognition.
3. If quantity/unit is stated: format as "quantity unit ingredient" (e.g., "2 cups flour", "1 tbsp olive oil")
4. INTELLIGENT MERGING ACROSS SOURCES
If an ingredient appears in BOTH description and transcript with different names or quantities:
- If one has quantity and one doesn't: Use the quantity source
- If one is GENERIC and one is SPECIFIC: Use specific name with caption quantity
  Examples of generic → specific:
  • "oil" + "olive oil" → "olive oil" (with quantity from caption)
  • "flour" + "bread flour" → "bread flour" (with quantity from caption)
  • "cheese" + "parmesan" → "parmesan" (with quantity from caption)
- If quantities differ: Prefer caption/description quantity (usually more accurate)

Example:
Caption: "8g oil"
Transcript: "then add the olive oil"
Output: "8 g olive oil"

5. If NO quantity/unit stated: just write the ingredient name (e.g., "salt", "pepper")
6. FRACTION FORMATTING: Keep fractions intact using "/" (e.g., "1/2 lb fresh mozzarella cheese", "1/2 cup butter", "1 1/2 lbs chicken")
7. One ingredient per line
8. Do not add any default quantities or units
9. Look through BOTH the post description AND video transcript
10. NESTED INGREDIENT BREAKDOWNS
When an ingredient shows a parent quantity followed by a breakdown into sub-ingredients, prefer the breakdown:
- Signal: Parent quantity + dash/hyphen + sub-ingredients on same line
- Math check: If sub-quantities add up to parent quantity, skip the parent
- Hierarchy check: If sub-ingredients are subtypes of parent (e.g., "bread flour" is type of "flour"), skip parent

Examples:
✅ "400g flour - 280 bread flour/120 AP flour" → Extract ONLY "280 g bread flour" and "120 g AP flour"
✅ "500g cheese - 300g cheddar/200g mozzarella" → Extract ONLY "300 g cheddar" and "200 g mozzarella"
❌ "400g flour" (no breakdown) → Extract "400 g flour" normally

PARSING EDGE CASES - Handle these carefully:
• DECIMAL NUMBERS: Fix spacing issues (e.g., "3. 5 g" → "3.5 g", "0. 5 tsp" → "0.5 tsp")
• RANGES: Pick the larger amount for main ingredient (e.g., "200-250 g chicken" → "250 g chicken breast")
• COMPLEX QUANTITIES: Simplify to main amount (e.g., "⅔ cup + 1 tbsp water" → "165 g water" OR "⅔ cup water")
• ALTERNATIVES: You can leave both in the final output (e.g., "chicken breast or thigh", "paprika or cayenne")
• DUPLICATE UNITS: Consolidate to single entry (e.g., "240 g flour" + "2 cups flour" → "240 g all-purpose flour")
• QUALITATIVE AMOUNTS: Treat as no quantity (e.g., "salt to taste" → "salt", "dill (optional)" → "dill")
• PREPARATION NOTES: Include only in ingredient name (e.g., "1 garlic clove, minced" → "1 garlic clove, minced")
• UNICODE FRACTIONS: Convert to slash format (e.g., "½ tsp" → "1/2 tsp", "¼ cup" → "1/4 cup")
• NESTED BREAKDOWNS: Extract only the detailed sub-ingredients when breakdown is given
  - "400g flour - 280 bread flour/120 AP flour" → "280 g bread flour" + "120 g AP flour" (NOT "400 g flour")
  - "500g cheese - 300g cheddar/200g mozzarella" → "300 g cheddar" + "200 g mozzarella"
• GENERIC VS SPECIFIC MERGING: When caption has generic + quantity, transcript has specific name
  - Caption: "8g oil" + Transcript: "olive oil" → "8 g olive oil"
  - Caption: "250g flour" + Transcript: "all-purpose flour" → "250 g all-purpose flour"
  - Caption: "100g cheese" + Transcript: "parmesan cheese" → "100 g parmesan cheese"
